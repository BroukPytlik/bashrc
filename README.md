# bashrc
My customized bash shell environment.

# Usage
    git clone git@github.com:BroukPytlik/bashrc.git ~/.bash
    ln -s ~/.bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc

Create a `~/.bash/private.rc` file for things like keys and passwords
in environment variables, and other stuff that should not get indexed by git.
